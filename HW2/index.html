<!--! I added some feedback in HW2/index.html & styles.css. Everything looked good Quick notes: I think some of the markup looks a redundant, however I had no issue reading so if you'd like to continue with your doing I think that would be fine. Classes and ids were good logically named. You didn't make the nav stick to the top of the browser, not sweating it as I know you built this solution from the images and that may have not been apparent. *I'm not asking you to add this to every HW* this is just a something to consider, I've seen you break up your markup in to logical sections with comments same with CSS. I would recommend continuing to do that in the development space, I do not expect you to do this for homework just wanted to mention it. If you set a value on a  parent class and the child has the same value I think its better form to set it to 100% instead of reiterating it. I added a folder called harcourt_solution that has my version of this project the responsiveness achieves the same thing but I did it quite differently, might be valuable to see it from a different perspective. Overall great job homework 2 looks great -->
